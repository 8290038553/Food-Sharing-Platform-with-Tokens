## Project Title
**Food-Sharing Platform with Tokens**

## Project Description
Food- A decentralized food-sharing network rewarding contributors with tokens.

## Project Vision
The vision of this project is to create a decentralized, sustainable platform that allows users to share excess food with others while being rewarded for their contribution. This platform aims to foster community support, reduce food waste, and create a more equitable food distribution system, utilizing a token-based model for exchange.

## Future Scope
The platform has substantial potential for future enhancements, including:
- **Partnerships with Businesses**: Integrating with restaurants, grocery stores, and food banks to create a more scalable sharing network.
- **Mobile Application**: Development of mobile apps for iOS and Android to make food sharing more accessible.
- **Token Utility Expansion**: Offering additional use cases for tokens, such as donations, or allowing them to be exchanged for goods and services.
- **Reputation System**: A rating system to build trust and security between users.

## Key Features
- **Decentralized Food Sharing**: Users can list surplus food and share it with others in the community.
- **Token Rewards**: Contributors earn tokens for sharing food, which can be used to claim food from others.
- **Food Listings**: Share and browse available food listings by food description, amount, and proximity.
- **Ownership Transfers**: Tokens can be transferred to others to facilitate the redistribution of food.
- **Sustainability**: Reducing food waste while building a resilient, community-driven network.
